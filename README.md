#### A little bit about the program:
The engaging flow of the game
and the sense of accomplishment
when achieving different materials
encourages the players to keep
playing and to discover more
recipes.

## WorkFlow
First, we built a design
prototype in Figma, defining
all our material base colors
and backgrounds, and how
each element will behave.

Afterwards we started
making the application part
by part, making all the small
components then moving to
the fragment layouts, and
lastly the game logic,
animations and sound
effects.
